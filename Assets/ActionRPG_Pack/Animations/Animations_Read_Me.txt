Animations included in this package are redistributable and are provided by Unity(from different Unity examples projects) or are a part of Carnegie Mellon University Motion Capture Database(http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/).

While Unity animations are high quality and are just fine for game production CMU animations are far from perfect. 

CMU animations have bad timing and often have unnecessary leg movement included. This make using some skills appear to a beginner like broken, but if you use quality animations from some recommended provider it will work great

I've decided to include them to give you chance to play this pack just after purchase.

Firstly you should change the "Crowbar" animation for player character. I used Mixamo "stable slash" for a web demo, but on the asset store you can find many other quality animations providers.
You should consider downloading this free animation: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5785   it is mechanim compatible and has no leg movement so it works great with this framework
While importing your animations remember to add events in the animation timeline and set their properties like in these included.

Other CMU animations that you would want to replace are zombie animations and open door and cast spell for player character.
