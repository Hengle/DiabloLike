0. If you import this package to an early version of Unity5 mechanim animator transitions will be messe up.
To fix this close Unity and open it again.

2.Demo and project setup:

Before you can run the demo you'll need to setup Layers and Layers Collision Mastrix in the edit/project settings/physics.
To help you with that I've included picture of how it supposed to look like:

	2.a. Layers:
	Setup layers in layers position starting from position 20 in the same order as on picture or listed below:
	20 Player
	21 Enemies
	22 EnemiesMouseCollider
	23 TargetingPlane
	24 Obstacles
	25 InteractiveObject
	26 Bullets
	27 TargetingPlaneToShoot
	28 Ground
	29 EnemyProjectiles
	30 DoT

	2.b.Layers Collision Mastrix:
	please see .jpg attached in this package to find out how to setup layers matrix.

	2.c. To use waypoint you also have to setup build settings.
	     To do that go to File/Build settings and add scenes from the demo to the build.

	2.d. In Unity5 you also have to setup tags: Please see attached picture.
	     - all children of "DoorPositionToNavigate" should have door tag
	     - MainCanvas should have MainCanvas tag
	     - TargetingPlane and TargetingPlaneToShoot should have targetingPlane tag
	     - Zombie and its child ColliderMouse should have enemy tag, same for ZombieBare
	     - Ray prefab should have DoT tag.
	     - It's easy to spot missing tag in a prefab: missing tag is called "Undefined"
